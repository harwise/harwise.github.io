# Metrics Prefixes

$G$ (giga) $M$ (mega) $k$ (kilo) $1$ $m$ (milli) $\mu$ (micro) $n$ (nano) $p$ (pico)

# Energy

Voltage  - Potential energy. Pressure.\
Current  - Kinetic energy. Flow.

Joule ($J$) - How much energy is transferred.\
Watt ($W$)  - Electric Power. The rate at which energy is transferred or transformed.

$$
1W = 1J \space per \space second
$$

$$
P = I \times V
$$

|Situation|Approximate Power|
|:-------:|:---------------:|
|Arduino Uno Micro-controller|0.25$W$|
|Cell Phone Transmitter|3$W$|
|Laptop Computer|65$W$|
|50-Inch LCD Television|150$W$|
|Microwave Oven|1000$W$|

# Battery

Nominal Voltage   - Output voltage after 50% discharge\
Capacity ($Ah$)   - Amp-hours. Amount of electrons. One amp of current for one hour at its rated voltage.

# Grounded vs. floating

GND (ground) - wall power outlets.\
COM (**own** common point) - batteries.
