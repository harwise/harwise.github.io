After going through Final Fantasy 7 Remake on PS4, I was obsessed to learn the whole story.

# Cloud Strife

* **Amnesiac** mercenary
* **Proclaimed** ex-solider
* **Fledgling** terrorist

Cloud Strife is the classic kind of spiky-haired ball of **angst** that you'll find in any final fantasy. Cloud grew up as a loner in the sleepy mountain town of Nibelheim. He heard tales of the hero Sephiroth and his elite group of warriors known as SOLDIERS. So, Cloud decided to enlist in the private military of the energy **conglomerate** Shinra in hopes of joining SOLDIERS himself. He wanted to be like Sephiroth, and want to impress the girl-next-door, Tifa Lockhart.

Cloud set off to the Shinra capital of Midgar to fulfill his dreams and become the bad ass that we know and love today, except he didn't. Cloud didn't qualify for the SOLDIER program, so he got placed into Shinra's ranks as a **lowly** **grunt**. Embarrassed and depressed by his failure, Cloud cut off all contact with his folks back home.

During his career as a Shinra militant, Could found a **kindred** spirit and **role model** in a SOLDIER named Zack Fair. The two became fast friends, but everything would change when they set off on a seemingly routine mission back to Cloud's hometown of Nibelheim.
