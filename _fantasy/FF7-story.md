Having finished "Final Fantasy 7 Remake" on PS4, I got intrigued to learn the whole story.

# Cloud Strife

* **Amnesiac** mercenary
* **Proclaimed** ex-solider
* **Fledgling** terrorist

Cloud Strife is the classic kind of spiky-haired ball of **angst** that you'll find in any final fantasy. Cloud grew up as a **loner** in the sleepy mountain town of Nibelheim. He heard tales of the hero Sephiroth and his elite group of warriors known as SOLDIERS. So, Cloud decided to enlist in the private military of the energy **conglomerate** Shinra in hopes of joining SOLDIERS himself. He wanted to be like Sephiroth, and want to impress the girl-next-door, Tifa Lockhart.

Cloud set off to the Shinra capital of Midgar to fulfill his dreams and become the bad ass that we know and love today, except he didn't. Cloud didn't qualify for the SOLDIER program, so he got placed into Shinra's ranks as a **lowly** **grunt**. Embarrassed and depressed by his failure, Cloud cut off all contact with his folks back home.

During his career as a Shinra militant, Could found a **kindred** spirit and **role model** in a SOLDIER named Zack Fair. The two became fast friends, but everything would change when they set off on a seemingly routine mission back to Cloud's hometown of Nibelheim.

# Nibelheim

* Small mountain community
* Hometown of Tifa and Cloud

Nibelheim is a sleepy little town at the base of Mt. Nibel, home to one of Shinra's Mako Reactor energy plants. When Cloud, Sephiroth, and Zack arrived to investigate a **malfunction** at the reactor, an embarrassed Cloud kept his helmet on the whole time to avoid having to talk to any of his old neighbors. To make things more awkward, Tifa was working as the mountain guide at the time. So, she was hired to lead the team to the reactor. At least she didn't recognized Cloud.

The mission took a strange turn when the team discovered the cause of the malfunction: an **infestation** of **mutated** monsters. You see, Nibelheim isn't just a popular tourist destination, it's also home to a secret Shinra laboratory hidden in the basement of a nearby **manor**. Perplexed by the **mutants** in the reactor, Sephiroth investigated the Shinra manor, where he discovered a secret that drove him insane. From there, Sephiroth went on a **rampage**, razing the village to the ground, killing many of its inhabitants, and kidnapping Tifa.

Cloud chased Sephiroth up the mountain to the reactor, where he found Tifa and Zack injured by Sephiroth. Cloud fought Sephiroth, but he stood no chance and Sephiroth promptly stabbed him with his nine-foot-long sword. No surprise there. However, with his **last ounce of strength**, Cloud **hoisted** Sephiroth up by the blade of his sword and **hurled** him into the reactor before passing out.

Shinra **operatives** found unconscious Zack and Cloud near the reactor and moved them to the laboratory in Shinra Manor. There, they performed **inhumane experiments** on the two of them using Mako energy. Since he was a SOLDIER, Zack was able to **withstand** it, but the **overexposure** to Mako left Cloud **physically and psychologically fractured**. After years in the lab, Zack was able to break him and his **catatonic** buddy out and make their way towards the Midgar.

They planned to work as mercenaries once Cloud had fully recovered, but a team of Shinra operatives attacked them once they reached the outskirts of Midgar. With his dying breath, Zack **bequeathed his Buster Sword to Cloud**, and told him to work in Midgar without him.

# Midgar

* Shinra capital
* Home of Avalanche and Aerith

As a sprawling industrial **metropolis**, Midgar is the base of operations for the Shinra empire. The whole city is powered by six huge Mako reactors, and it's structured made of a series of tiered plates stacked on top of each other. It's like a **dystopian** wedding cake. The wealthy live in comfort on the upper level where Shinra Headquarter is located. Everyone else is left to **fend for** themselves in the slums below. The lower levels are mostly run by criminal organizations and gangsters like Con Corneo. He keeps Shinra from interfering in his business by keeping them informed on any **ongoing** terrorist activities in the lower sectors.

Once Cloud got into Midgar, he **stumbled around the city** for a while, living on the streets while **mumbling** **incoherently** to himself. Luckily, Tifa was also living in Midgar. When she found Cloud, she invited him to work with her in a anti-Shinra **resistance group**, Avalanche.

# Tifa Lockhart

* Master of hand-to-hand combat
* Second-in-command of Avalanche
* Cloud's childhood neighbor

Last time we saw Tifa, Sephiroth left her heavily injured. Her martial arts instructor, Zangan, found her and took her to Midgar to get medical attention. After recovering, Tifa remained in Midgar and **joined up with** Barret Wallace, the leader of Avalanche.

When she finds Cloud, a wave of memories comes rushing back to him about their childhood friendship, but that never happened. Tifa and Cloud were never that close growing up. So, she started worrying about Cloud's mental state. As a way of keeping an eye on him, she did what any concerned friend would do: hired him as a mercenary for her terrorist group, duh.

As a member of Avalanche, Tifa bears many responsibilities for the group. She runs a bar Seventh Heaven as the team's headquarters. But Tifa also puts her expert hand-to-hand combat skill to work on missions.

After Cloud's first job with Avalanche is a success, she manages to convince him to stay with the group for a second mission. Cloud agrees to help fight **for her cause** despite his disagreement with Avalanche's **fiery** leader, Barret.

# Barret Wallace

* Leader of Avalanche
* Has a gun arm

Barret was once a simple married man living in a small mining town of Corel. When his wife, Myrna fell ill, he convinced the people of Corel to allow Shinra to build a Mako reactor near the community. He hoped that the corporate partnership can provide the resources needed to treat his wife. Barret's friend Dyne opposed the idea at first, but he **backed down** out of **respect for** Barret's reasoning.

Not long after the Corel reactor was built, Avalanche hijacked the facility. No, not Barret's Avalanche, but an earlier, more violent **incarnation** of the group. Barret and Dyne fought to help Shinra retake the reactor, but Shinra figured the people of Corel was responsible for this incident. So, they blew up the Mako plant and attacked the village **in retaliation** Barret and Dyne hurried back to save their town, but Shinra forces ambushed them, leaving the two in a literal **cliffhanger**. Barret saved Dyne from falling by grabbing his hand, but Scarlet, a Shinra's execute, shot both men's hands clean off, sending Dyne **tumbling into the abyss**. Despite the odds, Barret managed to escape with Dyne's daughter, Marlene, adopting her as his own.

He set off for Midgar, replaced his lost hand with a sweet machine gun, and formed his own version of Avalanche fo fight again Shinra. Sure, he wants to protect the planet from Shinra's environmentally harmful Mako harvesting, But **he's also out to** **avenge** his home, his wife and his best friend, and his arm.

# Avalanche

* Underground **eco-terrorist** group
* Led by Barret Wallace

Barret's cell of Avalanche is relatively separate from the more **militaristic** official **faction** of Avalanche referred to as Avalanche HQ. While Barret's team **disapproves of** Avalanche HQ's more violent methods, HQ isn't a fan of Barret's **chaotic** approach. Nonetheless, the two Avalanche groups in Midgar tend to stay out of each other's business. Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie Rasberry joined Barret's group, eager to fight against Shinra.

Jessie grew up in Sector 7's residential district. She dreamed of performing at the Gold **Saucer**. She'd just **landed the starring role** when her father got sicked with Mako poisoning from the Shinra plant where he worked. Jessie blamed Shinra for what happened, and **unbeknownst** to her family, joined up with Avalanche to **get revenge**. A skilled **tinkerer**, Jessie is responsible for crafting the bombs Avalanche uses in their attacks. She also has a bit of a crush on Cloud, and **flirts with** him nonstop despite getting rejected. Apparently, Avalanche doesn't have a **workplace harassment** **seminar**.

Biggs grew up as an orphan in the Sector 5 Slums. He became a teacher at his local orphanage where he served as a **role model** to many of the children. He eventually left the orphanage to fight for Avalanche, where he distinguishes himself both as a fighter and a **tactician**. He stills holds the children of his orphanage close to his heart and fights to give them a better future.

Wedge's passion for saving the planet is matched only by his love of food and his cats. An orphan like Biggs, Wedge sees himself as the weak link in the group. He often has doubts about his true **potential** as a **revolutionary**, maybe because he's constantly getting injured on missions. Even so, he probably doesn't realize how much he truly **contributes to** Avalanche's fight again Shinra.

# Shinra Electrical Power Company

* **Ruthless** mega-corporation
* Lead by President Shinra and his son Rufus
* Creators of the Jenova project.

Like any major **conglomerate**, the Shinra corporation is after money and power. Shinra rules much of the known world thanks to their main source of income: Mako energy. Mako energy is refined by drilling into the planet's core and harvesting the planet's Lifestream, the magical essence responsible for all of the life in the world. As you could imagine, this has some damaging effects on the environment. But hey, if it doesn't affect the bottom line, Shinra doesn't really care. So Shinra **makes serious bank off** of destroying the planet. But they've also got a **monopoly** on pretty much every other **unscrupulous** industry you can think of. They've even got their own private military **at their beck and call**, so Shinra is virtually unstoppable. With their weapons and science divisions, they can **invest in** cartoonishly evil ideas like the Jenova project. We'll get to that later.

Avalanche is the greatest thorn in Shinra's side, and their **guerilla tactics** always keep them one step ahead of the mega-corporation. Still, Shinra will stop at nothing to crush any form of **resistance**.

# Aerith Gainsborough

* Local flower seller
* Last of the Cetra

Aerith is a **plucky** young girl who sells flowers in the lower levels of Midgar. Cloud first encounters Aerith after **sabotaging** the Sector 1 Mako reactor. But they make proper introductions after Cloud takes a tumble into the Sector 5 slums. Aerith discovers him just in time: she's being hunted by the Turks, Shinra's **elite** **investigative team**. she **strikes a deal** with Cloud for him to act as her bodyguard, **in exchange for** a date with her. Though the **perpetually** awkward Cloud tries to **ditch** her after they get to safety, she continues to stick to him like glue.

Despite her **cheery demeanor**, Aerith has a heartbreaking past. Her mother was the last of an ancient race of magic-users called the Cetra, and her father was a former Shinra scientist, who helped her escape from Shinra's head researcher, Dr. Hojo. The two went into hiding, and soon gave birth to Aerith. But after the Turks found them, Dr. Hojo killed Aerith's father and started experimenting on Aerith and her mother. Seven years later, Aerith's mother managed to escape Shinra's headquarters with Aerith, but was **mortally** wounded in the process. With dying breath, Aerith's mother asked a woman named Elmyra Gainsborough to watch over Aerith. So Elmyra raised Aerith as her own and **hid her from the Turks**. As Aerith grew, she began to deny her heritage, but deep down, she knew the truth about herself and the Cetra.

In the Remake, Aerith is haunted by swarms of mysterious **Spectres**. At first, she's the only one who's able to see the ghosts, but when she touches Cloud for the first time, he's able to see them as well. The Whispers **harassed** both heroes throughout the story. Sometimes they appear to attack Aerith and Cloud, while other times they seem to be helping them. Mostly, they seem **concerned with** keeping Aerith and Cloud on the right track. No one knows the true connections between Aerith and these spirits. Are they related to the connection to the Lifestream, or her Cetra blood? Only time will tell.

# The Cetra

* Ancient race of **mystic** **nomads**
* The **caretakers** of the planet

The Cetra were an ancient race that **inhabited** Earth thousands of years ago. They had a unique ability to communicate with the planet thanks to their ancient wisdom about the Lifestream. The Cetra believed that if they wandered the planet, **nurturing** and cultivating it, the journey would one day lead them to the Promised Land, a **mythical** land of near infinite Mako energy.

Some Cetra strayed from their **nomadic** ways, and settled down, starting their own civilizations. The descendent of these Cetra would become the humans of present day. And then something really interesting happened: an **alien** showed up and killed then all. Well, almost all of them. The survivors **banded together** to use their magic to seal the alien away, trapping it in the **crater** where it was originally landed. 2,000 years later, Shinra would take a deep interest in the Cetra. Well, they were more interested in the vast energy of the Promised Land.

**Okie Dokie.** So, the Remake only covers the stuff that happens in Midgar. In other words, we'ar starting to get into uncharted territory. Sure, we've met Red XIII in the Remake, but we haven't really got the chance to know him yet. So **from here on in**, we're gonna **go by info** from the original Final Fantasy 7.
 
# Red XIII

* Real name: Nanaki
* **Guardian** of Cosmo Canyon

When Cloud and the gang attack Shinra's HQ to rescue Aerith, they find her locked in a cage with a fearsome lion-like creature. Bad news, right? Wrong! He's actually a **chill** guy named Nanaki. He's a member of a rare unnamed species of, essentially, talking cats. His family had long served as the protectors of Cosmo Canyon, **a natural wonder** inhabited by a tribe lead by the wise elder Bugenhagen.

When Nanaki was just a cub, his father disappeared. **A rival tribe** called the Gi was about to invade, so Red XIII figured his dad **bailed** to save himself. Soon after, his mother **passed away**, so Bugenhagen raised Nanaki himself as his grandfather. Even though Nanaki's 48, he's basically a teenager in his species' lifespan.

Nanaki **set out** for a **ritual** his species performs every 50 years to **appease** the planet. But before he could return home, the Turks kidnapped him and sent him off to Dr. Hojo's for his twisted experiments. **Dubbed** Red XIII by the Shinra researchers, Nanaki is **branded**, scarred, and **genetically** modified by Dr. Hojo. But his real power remains intact. After Cloud frees him, he helps the group escape from Midgar and leads them to his **ancestral** home: Cosmo Canyon. 

# Cosmo Canyon

* Home of Red XIII and Bugenhagen
* Natural **pilgrimage** site

Cosmo Canyon is a spiritual and natural **mecca** for many travelers. The community's wisest elder Bugenhagen, is a **devout** scholar of both nature and technology, and shares his **trove** of wisdom with Cloud and his team when they visit his **observatory**. Cosmo Canyon is also where the first version of Avalanche was founded several years earlier.

The people of Cosmo Canyon were historically **at odds** with the **warmongering** Gi Tribe, who tried to invade the town through the nearby caves. While Red XIII believed his father had fled the **impending** invasion, Bugenhagen unlocks the caves for Red XIII to show him the truth. His father had actually sacrificed himself in order to defeat the Gi, saving his son and the rest of Cosmo Canyon. Nanaki finally forgives his father, and the party continues their adventure.

# Gold Saucer

* Massive amusement park
* Built on the ruins of old Corel

With all the emotional and tragic backstories unfolding, the **gang** needs ome **R&R**. So they stopped at the Gold Saucer: a sprawling, **gilded** metropolis of fun and excitement. The Gold Saucer is divided into 7 squares: Round, Speed, Event, Ghost, Chocobo, Battle and Wonder. Each square has its own share of games and **attractions** to take part in. During their stay, Cloud even has his option to **go on a date** and **see the sights** with one of the female members of the party, or Barret if you're lucky.

But The Gold Saucer isn't all fun and games; the entire park is built on top of, you guessed it, another emotional and tragic backstory. I love Final Fantasy. We love it. Apparently, someone thought it would be a cute idea to build an amusement park right above Corel, Barret's old hometown. It turns out, Barret's old pal Dyne is still alive, has a gun-hand just like his, and has just been going on **murderous rampages** throughout The Gold Saucer. Pretty horrible, but, not as horrible as the other guy the gang meets here.

# Cait Sith

* **Surreptitious** fortune teller
* Secret Shinra agent

We just get a glimpse of Cait Sith in the Remake, but we can learn more about his **lore** from the original. Cait Sith is a, he's sort of like a cat? And he's got a **megaphone**, and like, a little crown, and a **cape**. And he's riding the giant, um, **marshmallow**-demon-thing?

Anyway, Cloud runs into him in Wonder square in The Gold Saucer, and he just offers to tell Cloud's fortune. Cloud's like, okay, fine. So, after Cait Sith's done, he's like, hey, I'm gonna **stick around with** the crew from now on actually. And instead of telling him to get lost, Cloud's just like, sure, whatever. Big mistake, because it turns out that Cait Sith is actually a **drone** that Shinra deployed to spy on Cloud and his friends. Okay, if Shinra was gonna make a robot designed to spy on people, why would they make it so annoying? Why would they make it so bad at combat? Why would they make it look like this?

Well, Cait Sith is actually **piloted** by Reeve Tuesti, Shinra's head of Urban Development. Anyway, Cait Sith betrays Cloud and the team, kidnapping Marlene and delivering the invaluable Keystone to the Turks. But he's inspired by the gang's devotion to saving the planet and quickly **has a change of heart**. He ends up sacrificing himself to obtain the Black Materia for the rest of the party. It's an emotionally **devastating** loss, or, it would be if he wasn't just a robot. Because a replacement Cait Sith shows up immediately afterwards to rejoin the party.

Oh, and in battle, Cait Sith has a move that can either kill every enemy in on hit, or, kill everyone in your party in one hit. You will never use him.

# Yuffie Kisaragi

* Self-styled materia thief
* Member of the Wutai Clan

We're sill waiting on Yuffie to make an appearance in the Remake, but in the original, Cloud and company can be attacked by a mysterious ninja girl. After she **gets the crud beaten out of her**, she introduces herself as Yuffie, and demands to join the team. She acts selfish, but she always **sticks by the party's side**, until they **drop by** her hometown of Wutai Village. Once they get to Wutai, Yuffie steals the party's stash and Materia and runs away. But the gang **catches up to** Yuffie. **She's being held hostage** by Midgar's friendly neighborhood crime boss Don Corneo. After her friends **beta the tar out of Corneo**, Yuffie apologizes, returns the stolen Materia and rejoins the team.

Yeah, Yuffie's a Materia-obsessed **kleptomaniac**, but she just wants to impress her father, the leader of the Wutai Clan. Yuffie's cocky and doesn't **respect Wutai traditions**, so she and her dad are constantly **at odds with** each other. But ever since the Wutai War, Yuffie's had an **innate need** to make him proud.

# The Wutai War

Roughly around the time Yuffie was born, a violent conflict **arose** between the Wutai Clan and Shinra. Shinra wanted to build a Mako Reactor in Wutai village, which didn't exactly **sit well with** the **tradition-oriented** Ninja clan. This sparked **an all-out war**. Despite Shinra's numbers, technology, and resources, the Wutai warriors put up a major fight thanks to their ninja training. Nonetheless, Shinra's SOLDIER program **tipped the scales in Shinra's favor**. Their golden boy Sephiroth distinguished himeself as a war hero, winning numerous key battles in the conflict, and the war ultimately ended when Zack Fair single-handedly captured Wutai Village.

With the Wutai defeated, Yuffie's father was forced to **concede to Shinra's demands**. He banned the use of Materia and allowing Wutai village to be transformed from **a sacred place of culture** to **a tourist trap**. Yuffie was burnt by her father's surrender, so she ran away from Wutai, vowing to find Materia that she believed could save her village from Shinra's control.

Yuffie's pretty helpful, but Cid Highwind is an invaluable member of Cloud's party.

# Cid Highwind

* Disgraced mechanical engineer
* Knows how to use a spear...
* ...For some reaon

We don't get much new background on Cid in the Remake, but we know that Cid's **a mechanic and scientist by trade**, and always dreamed of sending a rocket to outer space. With the help of Shinra's Space Program, it seemed like he was finally going to fulfill this dream. Unfortunately, he was forced to abort the launch at the last second to save his assistant, Shera. As a reslult of the launch's failure, Shinra abandoned their Space Program, leaving Cid's rocket sitting in the middle of a town as a landmark, and the **namesake** of Rocket Town. Shera blamed herself, and, hey, so did Cid. Shera spent the following years trying to **make it up to him**, while the **disgruntled** Cid just treated her like garbage.

Cid gets **a glimmer of hope** when Shinra's new president, Rufus, comes to vist Rocket Town, but Rufus dosen't want to renew the Space Program. He only wants to take Cid's **biplane**, the Tiny Bronco. When Cloud and his friends show up in Rocket Town, they catch Palmer, the directoror of Shinra Space Program, attempting to steal the Tiny Bronco. Cid helps them battle Palmer, who runs away and gets hit by a truck. Cid and the gang then escape from Shinra with Cid grabbing onto the plane as it flys away, **begrudingly** becoming a member of the party.

Cid's a **foul-mouthed**, **cynical** old **bastard**. He doesn't have much interest in the team's quest to, uh, save the world. Still, he's not gonna let Shinra relaunch his rocket. Besides, the gang needs to take the Huge Materia that powers the rocket in order to stop Sephiroth. **Ironically**, Cid trys to stop his own rocket from launching, but Shinra locks them in the rocket before **blasting it off** into space. Once Cid sees the planet from space, he realizes he's finnally achieved his dream, and that the world needs him to stop sephiroth. So, with Shera's help, he and the rest of the gang finally make it back to Earth, and Cid continues the quest with **a newfound sense of purpose**. He also flies the airship later. It's pretty sick.

# Vincent Valentine

* Former Turk
* Shapeshifting **werewolf** guy

We haven't seen him in the Remake, but Vincent has one of the most improtant backstories. Once upon a time, Vincent was a Turk working with Shinra. He had a crush on a Shinra scientist named Lucrecia, but she ended up marrying Shinra's head researcher Professor Hojo, and became pregnant with Hojo's child. Hojo intended to use his unborn son as a test subject for his greatest project yet, so he started experimenting on a pregnant Lucrecia. Vincent noticed her health start to **deteriorate**, so he confronted Hojo to tell him to put a stop to this madness. Well, Hojo shot Vincent in the chest and sarted performing horrible experiments on him, because, why not? As time passed, Vincent showed no signs of, not being dead anymore. So, in **a last-ditch effort** to save him, Lucrecia **infused him with** the **demonic** Chaos-infused mako, as well as its balancing counterpart, the Protomateria. Vincent awoke, alone, in Hojo's abandoned laboratory in the basement of Shinra Manor.

He now had **superhuman** strength and **agility**, as well as the ability to turn into a wolf-like chaos form thanks to Lucrecia's precedure. Vincent figured that Lucrecia was dead, and he blamed himself for it. Apparently, there was a big Dracula coffin lying around in this top-secret laboratory, so as a punishment, Vincent locked himself inside it. He slept there for 20 years, **reliving the tragedies** he suffered at the hands of Hojo in his nightmares.

When Cloud and his friends **awaken** this **angsty** vampire werewolf man, Vincent decides to team up with them to fight Shinra, and later, star in his own **spin-off** game. But what ever happened to Lucrecia's baby.

# The Jenova Project And Sephiroth

So, remember that big **alien** that nearly **wiped out** The Cetra? Well, Shinra found it frozen it in a **crater**, and mistook it for a Cetra. I mean, it's a super easy mistake, I guess. Hojo and his team **dubbed** the specimen Jenova and immediately got to work, trying to figure out how they could use it. At first, they tried to use Jenova to find more Mako to drill. But once that didn't work out, the Jenova Project became all about creating some super soldiers by injecting an unborn child with cells from Jenova's body. And the very first test subject turned out to be, you guessed it, Hojo and Lucrecia's baby, who turned out to be, you guessed it again, Sephiroth!

Sephiroth was taken from his parents and **raised to become** a SOLDIER. And hey, he was so good at killing things that he got famous for it. All Sephiroth knew about his origins was that his mother was named Jenova, which is true, in a sort of **messed up** way. In reality, Jenova wasn't as much his Mom as it was a part of him, if not him entirely. Well, when he discovered the Shinra Manor in Nibelheim, he found all of Dr. Hojo's notes about the Jenova project and how he was born. If Sephiroth had any marbles at that point, he lost them then. He became **unhinged** and **obsessed with destroying the world**, accomplishing what Jenova had tried to do thousands of years before.

Cloud's and Sephiroth's fates are connected, but it's by more than just some bad blood. When Hojo **abducted** Cloud after the Nibelheim incident, he injected him with Jenova cells. As Hojo theorized, when Jenova cells are separated, they are compelled to **reunite**, so Cloud is **inexplicably** drawn to Sephiroth throughout his journey. Sephiroth is the central convergence of Jenova itself, so he's even able to control Cloud's mind at certain points. If Cloud can ever hope to defeat Sephiroth, he'll need to **sever the ties** that allow his **nemesis** to control him.
