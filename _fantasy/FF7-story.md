After having finished "Final Fantasy 7 Remake" on PS4, I was intrigued to know the whole story.

# Cloud Strife

* **Amnesiac** mercenary
* **Proclaimed** ex-solider
* **Fledgling** terrorist

Cloud Strife is the classic kind of spiky-haired ball of **angst** that you'll find in any final fantasy. Cloud grew up as a loner in the sleepy mountain town of Nibelheim. He heard tales of the hero Sephiroth and his elite group of warriors known as SOLDIERS. So, Cloud decided to enlist in the private military of the energy **conglomerate** Shinra in hopes of joining SOLDIERS himself. He wanted to be like Sephiroth, and want to impress the girl-next-door, Tifa Lockhart.

Cloud set off to the Shinra capital of Midgar to fulfill his dreams and become the bad ass that we know and love today, except he didn't. Cloud didn't qualify for the SOLDIER program, so he got placed into Shinra's ranks as a **lowly** **grunt**. Embarrassed and depressed by his failure, Cloud cut off all contact with his folks back home.

During his career as a Shinra militant, Could found a **kindred** spirit and **role model** in a SOLDIER named Zack Fair. The two became fast friends, but everything would change when they set off on a seemingly routine mission back to Cloud's hometown of Nibelheim.

# Nibelheim

* Small mountain community
* Hometown of Tifa and Cloud

Nibelheim is a sleepy little town at the base of Mt. Nibel, home to one of Shinra's Mako Reactor energy plants. When Cloud, Sephiroth, and Zack arrived to investigate a **malfunction** at the reactor, an embarrassed Cloud kept his helmet on the whole time to avoid having to talk to any of his old neighbors. To make things more awkward, Tifa was working as the mountain guide at the time. So, she was hired to lead the team to the reactor. At least she didn't recognized Cloud.

The mission took a strange turn when the team discovered the cause of the malfunction: an **infestation** of **mutated** monsters. You see, Nibelheim isn't just a popular tourist destination, it's also home to a secret Shinra laboratory hidden in the basement of a nearby **manor**. Perplexed by the **mutants** in the reactor, Sephiroth investigated the Shinra manor, where he discovered a secret that drove him insane. From there, Sephiroth went on a **rampage**, razing the village to the ground, killing many of its inhabitants, and kidnapping Tifa.

Cloud chased Sephiroth up the mountain to the reactor, where he found Tifa and Zack injured by Sephiroth. Cloud fought Sephiroth, but he stood no chance and Sephiroth promptly stabbed him with his nine-foot-long sword. No surprise there. However, with his **last ounce of strength**, Cloud **hoisted** Sephiroth up by the blade of his sword and **hurled** him into the reactor before passing out.

Shinra **operatives** found unconscious Zack and Cloud near the reactor and moved them to the laboratory in Shinra Manor. There, they performed **inhumane experiments** on the two of them using Mako energy. Since he was a soldier, Zack was able to **withstand** it, but the **overexposure** to Mako left Cloud **physically and psychologically fractured**. After years in the lab, Zack was able to break him and his **catatonic** buddy out and make their way towards the Midgar.

They planned to work as mercenaries once Cloud had fully recovered, but a team of Shinra operatives attacked them once they reached the outskirts of Midgar. With his dying breath, Zack bequeathed his Buster Sword to Cloud, and told him to work in Midgar without him.

# Midgar

* Shinra capital
* Home of Avalanche and Aerith

As a sprawling industrial **metropolis**, Midgar is the base of operations for the Shinra empire. The whole city is powered by six huge Mako reactors, and it's structured made of a series of tiered plates stacked on top of each other. It's like a **dystopian** wedding cake. The wealthy live in comfort on the upper level where Shinra Headquarter is located. Everyone else is left to **fend for** themselves in the slums below. The lower levels are mostly run by criminal organizations and gangsters like Con Corneo. He keeps Shinra from interfering in his business by keeping them informed on any **ongoing** terrorist activities in the lower sectors.

Once Cloud got into Midgar, he stumbled around the city for a while, living on the streets while **mumbling** **incoherently** to himself. Luckily, Tifa was also living in Midgar. When she found Cloud, she invited him to work with her in a anti-Shinra **resistance group**, Avalanche.
