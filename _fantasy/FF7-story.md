After having finished "Final Fantasy 7 Remake" on PS4, I was intrigued to learn the whole story.

# Cloud Strife

* **Amnesiac** mercenary
* **Proclaimed** ex-solider
* **Fledgling** terrorist

Cloud Strife is the classic kind of spiky-haired ball of **angst** that you'll find in any final fantasy. Cloud grew up as a **loner** in the sleepy mountain town of Nibelheim. He heard tales of the hero Sephiroth and his elite group of warriors known as SOLDIERS. So, Cloud decided to enlist in the private military of the energy **conglomerate** Shinra in hopes of joining SOLDIERS himself. He wanted to be like Sephiroth, and want to impress the girl-next-door, Tifa Lockhart.

Cloud set off to the Shinra capital of Midgar to fulfill his dreams and become the bad ass that we know and love today, except he didn't. Cloud didn't qualify for the SOLDIER program, so he got placed into Shinra's ranks as a **lowly** **grunt**. Embarrassed and depressed by his failure, Cloud cut off all contact with his folks back home.

During his career as a Shinra militant, Could found a **kindred** spirit and **role model** in a SOLDIER named Zack Fair. The two became fast friends, but everything would change when they set off on a seemingly routine mission back to Cloud's hometown of Nibelheim.

# Nibelheim

* Small mountain community
* Hometown of Tifa and Cloud

Nibelheim is a sleepy little town at the base of Mt. Nibel, home to one of Shinra's Mako Reactor energy plants. When Cloud, Sephiroth, and Zack arrived to investigate a **malfunction** at the reactor, an embarrassed Cloud kept his helmet on the whole time to avoid having to talk to any of his old neighbors. To make things more awkward, Tifa was working as the mountain guide at the time. So, she was hired to lead the team to the reactor. At least she didn't recognized Cloud.

The mission took a strange turn when the team discovered the cause of the malfunction: an **infestation** of **mutated** monsters. You see, Nibelheim isn't just a popular tourist destination, it's also home to a secret Shinra laboratory hidden in the basement of a nearby **manor**. Perplexed by the **mutants** in the reactor, Sephiroth investigated the Shinra manor, where he discovered a secret that drove him insane. From there, Sephiroth went on a **rampage**, razing the village to the ground, killing many of its inhabitants, and kidnapping Tifa.

Cloud chased Sephiroth up the mountain to the reactor, where he found Tifa and Zack injured by Sephiroth. Cloud fought Sephiroth, but he stood no chance and Sephiroth promptly stabbed him with his nine-foot-long sword. No surprise there. However, with his **last ounce of strength**, Cloud **hoisted** Sephiroth up by the blade of his sword and **hurled** him into the reactor before passing out.

Shinra **operatives** found unconscious Zack and Cloud near the reactor and moved them to the laboratory in Shinra Manor. There, they performed **inhumane experiments** on the two of them using Mako energy. Since he was a SOLDIER, Zack was able to **withstand** it, but the **overexposure** to Mako left Cloud **physically and psychologically fractured**. After years in the lab, Zack was able to break him and his **catatonic** buddy out and make their way towards the Midgar.

They planned to work as mercenaries once Cloud had fully recovered, but a team of Shinra operatives attacked them once they reached the outskirts of Midgar. With his dying breath, Zack bequeathed his Buster Sword to Cloud, and told him to work in Midgar without him.

# Midgar

* Shinra capital
* Home of Avalanche and Aerith

As a sprawling industrial **metropolis**, Midgar is the base of operations for the Shinra empire. The whole city is powered by six huge Mako reactors, and it's structured made of a series of tiered plates stacked on top of each other. It's like a **dystopian** wedding cake. The wealthy live in comfort on the upper level where Shinra Headquarter is located. Everyone else is left to **fend for** themselves in the slums below. The lower levels are mostly run by criminal organizations and gangsters like Con Corneo. He keeps Shinra from interfering in his business by keeping them informed on any **ongoing** terrorist activities in the lower sectors.

Once Cloud got into Midgar, he stumbled around the city for a while, living on the streets while **mumbling** **incoherently** to himself. Luckily, Tifa was also living in Midgar. When she found Cloud, she invited him to work with her in a anti-Shinra **resistance group**, Avalanche.

# Tifa Lockhart

* Master of hand-to-hand combat
* Second-in-command of Avalanche
* Cloud's childhood neighbor

Last time we saw Tifa, Sephiroth left her heavily injured. Her martial arts instructor, Zangan, found her and took her to Midgar to get medical attention. After recovering, Tifa remained in Midgar and **joined up with** Barret Wallace, the leader of Avalanche.

When she finds Cloud, a wave of memories comes rushing back to him about their childhood friendship, but that never happened. Tifa and Cloud were never that close growing up. So, she started worrying about Cloud's mental state. As a way of keeping an eye on him, she did what any concerned friend would do: hired him as a mercenary for her terrorist group, duh.

As a member of Avalanche, Tifa bears many responsibilities for the group. She runs a bar Seventh Heaven as the team's headquarters. But Tifa also puts her expert hand-to-hand combat skill to work on missions.

After Cloud's first job with Avalanche is a success, she manages to convince him to stay with the group for a second mission. Cloud agrees to help fight **for her cause** despite his disagreement with Avalanche's **fiery** leader, Barret.

# Barret Wallace

* Leader of Avalanche
* Has a gun arm

Barret was once a simple married man living in a small mining town of Corel. When his wife, Myrna fell ill, he convinced the people of Corel to allow Shinra to build a Mako reactor near the community. He hoped that the corporate partnership can provide the resources needed to treat his wife. Barret's friend Dyne opposed the idea at first, but he **backed down** out of **respect for** Barret's reasoning.

Not long after the Corel reactor was built, Avalanche hijacked the facility. No, not Barret's Avalanche, but an earlier, more violent **incarnation** of the group. Barret and Dyne fought to help Shinra retake the reactor, but Shinra figured the people of Corel was responsible for this incident. So, they blew up the Mako plant and attacked the village **in retaliation** Barret and Dyne hurried back to save their town, but Shinra forces ambushed them, leaving the two in a literal **cliffhanger**. Barret saved Dyne from falling by grabbing his hand, but Scarlet, a Shinra's execute, shot both men's hands clean off, sending Dyne **tumbling** into the **abyss**. Despite the odds, Barret managed to escape with Dyne's daughter, Marlene, adopting her as his own.

He set off for Midgar, replaced his lost hand with a sweet machine gun, and formed his own version of Avalanche fo fight again Shinra. Sure, he wants to protect the planet from Shinra's environmentally harmful Mako harvesting, But **he's also out to** **avenge** his home, his wife and his best friend, and his arm.

# Avalanche

* Underground eco-terrorist group
* Led by Barret Wallace

Barret's cell of Avalanche is relatively separate from the more **militaristic** official faction of Avalanche referred to as Avalanche HQ. While Barret's team **disapproves of** Avalanche HQ's more violent methods, HQ isn't a fan of Barret's **chaotic** approach. Nonetheless, the two Avalanche groups in Midgar tend to stay out of each other's business. Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie Rasberry joined Barret's group, eager to fight against Shinra.

Jessie grew up in Sector 7's residential district. She dreamed of performing at the Gold **Saucer**. She'd just **landed the starring role** when her father got sicked with Mako poisoning from the Shinra plant where he worked. Jessie blamed Shinra for what happened, and **unbeknownst** to her family, joined up with Avalanche to **get revenge**. A skilled **tinkerer**, Jessie is responsible for crafting the bombs Avalanche uses in their attacks. She also has a bit of a crush on Cloud, and **flirts with** him nonstop despite getting rejected. Apparently, Avalanche doesn't have a **workplace harassment** **seminar**.

Biggs grew up as an orphan in the Sector 5 Slums. He became a teacher at his local orphanage where he served as a **role model** to many of the children. He eventually left the orphanage to fight for Avalanche, where he distinguishes himself both as a fighter and a **tactician**. He stills holds the children of his orphanage close to his heart and fights to give them a better future.

Wedge's passion for saving the planet is matched only by his love of food and his cats. An orphan like Biggs, Wedge sees himself as the weak link in the group. He often has doubts about his true **potential** as a **revolutionary**, maybe because he's constantly getting injured on missions. Even so, he probably doesn't realize how much he truly **contributes to** Avalanche's fight again Shinra.

# Shinra Electrical Power Company

* **Ruthless** mega-corporation
* Lead by President Shinra and his son Rufus
* Creators of the Jenova project.

Like any major **conglomerate**, the Shinra corporation is after money and power. Shinra rules much of the known world thanks to their main source of income: Mako energy. Mako energy is refined by drilling into the planet's core and harvesting the planet's Lifestream, the magical essence responsible for all of the life in the world. As you could imagine, this has some damaging effects on the environment. But hey, if it doesn't affect the bottom line, Shinra doesn't really care. So Shinra **makes serious bank off** of destroying the planet. But they've also got a **monopoly** on pretty much every other **unscrupulous** industry you can think of. They've even got their own private military **at their beck and call**, so Shinra is virtually unstoppable. With their weapons and science divisions, they can **invest in** cartoonishly evil ideas like the Jenova project. We'll get to that later.

Avalanche is the greatest thorn in Shinra's side, and their **guerilla tactics** always keep them one step ahead of the mega-corporation. Still, Shinra will stop at nothing to crush any form of **resistance**.

# Aerith Gainsborough

* Local flower seller
* Last of the Cetra

Aerith is a **plucky** young girl who sells flowers in the lower levels of Midgar. Cloud first encounters Aerith after **sabotaging** the Sector 1 Mako reactor. But they make proper introductions after Cloud takes a tumble into the Sector 5 slums. Aerith discovers him just in time: she's being hunted by the Turks, Shinra's **elite** investigating team. she **strikes a deal** with Cloud for him to act as her bodyguard, **in exchange for** a date with her. Though the **perpetually** awkward Cloud tries to **ditch** her after they get to safety, she continues to stick to him like glue.

Despite her **cheery demeanor**, Aerith has a heartbreaking past. Her mother was the last of an ancient race of magic-users called the Cetra, and her father was a former Shinra scientist, who helped her escape from Shinra's head researcher, Dr. Hojo. The two went into hiding, and soon gave birth to Aerith. But after the Turks found them, Dr. Hojo killed Aerith's father and started experimenting on Aerith and her mother. Seven years later, Aerith's mother managed to escape Shinra's headquarters with Aerith, but was **mortally** wounded in the process. With dying breath, Aerith's mother asked a woman named Elmyra Gainsborough to watch over Aerith. So Elmyra raised Aerith as her own and **hid her from the Turks**. As Aerith grew, she began to deny her heritage, but deep down, she knew the truth about herself and the Cetra.

In the Remake, Aerith is haunted by swarms of mysterious **Spectres**. At first, she's the only one who's able to see the ghosts, but when she touches Cloud for the first time, he's able to see them as well. The Whispers **harassed** both heroes throughout the story. Sometimes they appear to attack Aerith and Cloud, while other times they seem to be helping them. Mostly, they seem **concerned with** keeping Aerith and Cloud on the right track. No one knows the true connections between Aerith and these spirits. Are they related to the connection to the Lifestream, or her Cetra blood? Only time will tell.
