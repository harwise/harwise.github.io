## Darksiders III

Our story begins with the creation of an ancient race called the Nephilim: the Creator's first warriors. When the Creator gives the paradise of Eden to the race of Man, the Nephilim become angered and attack the ArchAgnels there. Four Nephilim are taken as agents by the Charred Council (the **mediators** created to keep the balance between the forces of Heaven and Hell), and are given **immense power** and the title of the Four Horsemen of the **Apocalypse**. The horsemen then help the army of Angels fight the rest of the Nephilim, leading to their extinction.

## The Graphic Adventure

The youngest horseman, War, does not **succumb to** the Council's will easily, and goes to Earth to battle with the army of Man. However, his three siblings are sent by Council to **reign him in**. A short battle **ensue**s, and it ends with War's brother Death cutting off his left arm, which War later replaces with a **gauntlet** to remember this lesson.
