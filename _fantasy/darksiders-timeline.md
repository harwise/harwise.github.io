## Darksiders III

Our story begins with the creation of an ancient race called the Nephilim: the Creator's first warriors. When the Creator gives the paradise of Eden to the race of Man, the Nephilim become angered and attack the ArchAgnels there. Four Nephilim are taken as agents by the Charred Council (the **mediators** created to keep the balance between the forces of Heaven and Hell), and are given **immense power** and the title of the Four Horsemen of the **Apocalypse**. The horsemen then help the army of Angels fight the rest of the Nephilim, leading to their extinction.

## The Graphic Adventure

The youngest horseman, War, does not **succumb to** the Council's will easily, and goes to Earth to battle with the army of Man. However, his three siblings are sent by Council to **reign him in**. A short battle **ensue**s, and it ends with War's brother Death cutting off his left arm, which War later replaces with a **gauntlet** to remember this lesson.

## The Abomination Vault

Several centuries later, we find Death (the eldest of the Four Horsemen), on **a barren world** after travelling the worlds of Creation alone for 500 years. He is visited by a creature known as Panoptos, who informs Death that he was sent to retrieve the Horseman and bring him before the Charred Council. Death refuses to speak to the Council, but Panoptos informs him that their business relates to an attack **on the boundaries of Eden**, which prompts Death to head there to investigate himself.

Upon arriving, Death finds no evidence of a battle, aside from a defeated Angel, whose spirit he **revives** to **interrogate** about the attack. He learns that the Angels **stationed on Eden's boundary** were attacked by an army of Constructs (beings created by a race known as the Makers). They were nearly **overrun** before Abaddon, a leader of one of Heaven's forces known as the Hellguard, arrived with **reinforcements**. 

His interrogation is **cut short** when another group of Angels arrive, and the clean battlefield is revealed to have been an illusion created by another Angel, Azrael, to prevent any other enemies from discovering their current weakness. Azrael takes Death to a nearby camp to meet with Abaddon. Death discovers that Abaddon lost his eye in the preceding battle to a powerful sword that Death recognizes as an ancient weapon called "Affliction", which was later lost by the Nephilim. Fearing that other ancient weapons might have been discovered and obtained by their unknown attackers, Death heads off to Kothysos, where Affliction was originally lost.

There, Death finds another crew of Constructs **wrapping up** an **excavation operation**, and comes to the conclusion that their **foe** must have already found what they were looking for there. Death then notices his **crow**, Dust, in a panic. He **makes his way to** the Crowfather, a member of an ancient race called the "Old Ones", who maintained a connection with Dust, and discovers an attack on his domain by the Constructs.

They **fend off the attack**, and the two are able to extract knowledge from one of the fallen Constructs to learn that the army was built by a Maker named Belisatra to find a way to awake the "Grand Abominations": tools created by the Nephilim from a race called the Ravaiim after their **extermination** **at their hands**.

Meanwhile, Death's brother, War, was tasked by the Charred Council to destroy a weapon held by the Angels that might disrupt the balance called the "**sacrament** bomb". Death (should be War?) heads to the Angel's White City, **infiltrating** it and finding the weapon, slaughtering several Angels on his way. Upon reaching it he finds it guarded by uriel, a young Angel in training. She attempts to stop him, but due to her inexperience, War simply **casts her aside** and destroys the weapon, heading off to return to the Council with his results.

Death also returns to the Charred Council to meet with the other three Horsemen and give his report. He reveals his knowledge and history with the Abominations, but refuses to reveal the location of the Vault in which they are currently held. The Council commands the four Horsemen to investigate, but upon leaving, Death convinces the others to stay away until he calls upon them.

After leaving, the Crow Father contacts Death through Dust to reveal that he learned that the invasion of his realm was led by an Angel. Death then heads to the Library of the Argent Spire in the Angel's White City to search for any leads on Belisatra. However, upon arriving, the Angels **are less than receptive** to Death, due to his brother's recent actions. He's able to convince them to let him in and is met by his **escort**, a Angel calling himself Semyaza. However, the Angel ambushes him and after a short battle stabs him with Affliction. War arrives **in the nick of time**, causing the angel to **retreat**.

The two then make their way to the Library, where they meet with Azrael, who informs that the angle they met was not actually Semyaza. They learn that Belisatra was an **apprentice** to a Maker named Gulbannan who was a lover of Lilith, the Queen of Demons and creator of the Nephilim, before his murder. The two make their way to Hell to meet with Lilith, but Death speaks to her alone, leaving War as a **look-out**. Lilith reveals that Gulbannan had taught her how to craft life, and realizing what she can do with it, decided to tell other Makers to hopefully stop her from doing so. Belisatra killed Gulbannan to pervent him from doing so, and became Lilith's **servant** **afterwards**. However, she left her position after a meeting with an Angel named Hadrimon.

Death and War determine that Hadrimon must be the Angel behind the plot to find the Grand Abominations, and they head to Gulbannan's former workshop, which they **hypothesize** to be where Belisatra is conducting her work. There the horsemen find Hadrimon and Belisatra, who put up a fight before they are all **surprise attacked** by an army of demons. Hadrimon and Belisatra esacape admist the chaos, and the brothers are able to defeat the attacking army.

The two determine that the Demons must have attacked to obtain whatever Grand Abomination was there before their **foes** escaped with it. They do, however, find an old Abomination: a shield called Mortis. However, *upon* **wielding** it, Death accidentally leaves his mind open to the connection it maintains with Afflication, allowing Hadrimon to learn the secret of the Grand Abomination activation: the blood of the Ravaiim.

The Horsemen head to the **scorched** world of the Ravaiim, hoping to retrieve the blood before Hadrimon can. There they meet with a group of Angels led by Azrael, sent by the Charred Council. Azrael, upon learning Hadrimon's name, reveals that the Angel had fallen from Heaven after revealing his forbidden love with another Angel named Raciel. Raciel was cast to Hell as punishment, and Hadrimon, **furious at** this decision, **sought** war against the forces of both Heaven and Hell.  

Death, War and the Angels eventually find Belisatra's constructs and begin to take them out before they are again attacked by a demonic army, led by a Lost Angel Death determines to be Raciel. They are then joined by Hadrimon, **wielding** an Abomination **pistol** called Black Mercy, and Belisatra wielding Earth Reaver: a massive Grand Abomination capable of **volcanic eruptions**. The Horsemen and Angels **retreat**, but are able to destroy Earth Reaver's support, temporarily disabling it. Knowing time is short, Death hatches a plan to extract the blood of the Ravaiim and **condense** it to a single **vial**. He sends the Angels with a **decoy**, and War with the real vial before using Mortis again to **reveal the plan to Hadrimon**. However, he actually sent War with a fake vial as well, and kept the real vial to himself.

With his enemies misled to attack his brother, Death takes the blood to the Keeper of **Oblivion**, convincing him to **banish it into Oblivion** before heading off to find War. However, when he dose, he finds his brother slain on the battlefield. He's able to use a small amount of life contained in his brother's sword, Chaoseater, to **revive** his brother, revealing that the blood was destroyed, but **refrains from** revealing his **ruse** that led to War's death.

The two return to the Charred Council who reveal that their destruction of the blood did not stop Hadrimon, who had attacked an Angel **outpost** using the traces of blood contained within Earth Reaver. The council give Death and War one final chance, and send them to guard the Abomination Vault, with their siblings, Fury and Strife, sent to **hunt down** Hadrimon and Belisatra. However, Death knows full well that their foes will be coming to them to obtain the Abominations, as well as the traces of blood contained within.

The two horsemen head to Death's home, which **is revealed to** be beside the entrance to the Vault. Shortly after arriving, Belisatra's Constructs attack, but **are held off** by Death's skeleton defenses. Hadrimon arrives with Black Mercy, as does Belisatra with her own cannon. Hadrimon **makes his way to the entrance** to the Vault, just as Raciel arrives with her forces to destroy the Construct army.

Death and Hadrimon meet at **the portal to the Vault**, and the horseman destroys the seal, hoping that the presences of the Abominations within would overwhelm Hadrimon through Black Mercy. This **somewhat** succeeds, the the weapon itself takes control of Hadrimon's arm, firing at Death, who is able to block the blow, **is left incapacitated**. Just then, Raciel enters the chamber, and Black Mercy again takes control and fires, killing her immediately, This causes Hadrimon to **regain control**, and with an overwhelming sadness and regret, **holds the gun to his own head**, but it refuses to fire.

He looks over to Raciel's corpse, and above it, he sees her former self, **pleading with him to stop** and expressing her forgiveness. This distraction allows Death to strike, and finally kill the fallen Angel. As he leaves the chamber, **it is revealed that** Hadrimon's vision of his love was a projection created by Azrael. Outside, they confront Belisatra, who surrenders and is taken to the Charrred Council to be judged. Death, War and Azrael celebrate their victory, despite **the devious way** they achieved it. Death then returns the Abomonations to the Vlaut and heads to the Charred Council.

There, Panoptos suggests to the Council that they create more servants of his kind to be assigned to each Horseman to keep them loyal, thus creating what are known as the "Wathcers". On his way out, Death encounters the creature, and reveals that he **is aware that** Raciel's army were **doing his bidding**, as Panoptos had hoped the power of the Abominations would help him escape the Council's control. Without proof, he knew he couldn't convince the Council of this, but left Panoptos with a warning before going into the chamber to give his report.
